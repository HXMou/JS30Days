# JavaScript30

When I was reading [the Front-end developer's roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner), I deeply agree with "to build as many projects as possible" in Important Tip part and release that is exactly what I lack in my CV and GitHub. Thus, I joined the [Build 30 JavaScript Projects in 30 Days](https://javascript30.com/) challenge, created by Wes Bos, and will record down and track my study path in this challenge. 🌟

## D01

- Self-defined HTML attribute form: `data`-name.  Use in the same way as standard HTML tag attribute, like `<div class ="key" data-name="65">`
- Attribute selector 
- querySelector
- Can not add evetListener to an array, have to use forEach to get every element.
